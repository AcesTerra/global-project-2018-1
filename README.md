# Global Project 2018-1
Repository of IS 579/379 VIRTUAL SOFTWARE TEAMS

The goal of this class it to develop the following system:

A time reporting application

The DePaul iD-Lab is seeking assistance with developing a time reporting system.  The system should be web and mobile accessible.  The goal of the application is to allow students the ability to insert their working hours and management the ability to preview them and email them. Students will be able to submit hours worked for a week in an online form.  Once students have entered the hours, managers should be able to preview the hours and approve them.  If hours are approved at the end of the week they should be able to send an email with all student hours to an additional admin.  The application should allow students to edit hours if necessary.  Students should also receive a confirmation when their hours are approved.  Managers should be able to add / remove users as new employees join the lab.  Ease of use is an important consideration.

A scheduling system

The DePaul iD-Lab is seeking assistance with developing a work scheduling and calendar.  The system should be web and mobile accessible.  The goal of the application is to allow students the ability to enter hours they are available for work or meetings. The system will allow students the ability to enter hours they will be available for throughout a school term or on a weekly basis.  Managers should be allowed to add / remove new students and view the schedules. It is important that the visualization for the hours is visually appealing and usable.
